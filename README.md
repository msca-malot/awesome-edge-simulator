### Motivation

no simulation tool capable of modeling Pure Edge Computing environments, which includes
- offloading the tasks between edge devices and balancing their load
- simulating their heterogeneity
- measuring their energy consumption and their resources utilization

### Features

- simulation of resource management strategies
- performance evaluation of Cloud, Fog, and Pure Edge environments in terms of
  - delays
  - energy consumption
  - network congestion
  - resource utilization
  - task success rate
- thousands od device (scalability)
- device heterogenity
  - fix or mobile
  - battery or power supply
  - latency requirement
- tasks orchestrator module that manages the available resources, balances the workload, and enables the simulation of multi-tiers scenarios where many computing paradigms can be used in conjunction with one another

## IoTSim-Edge

[A simulation framework for modeling the behavior of Internet of Things and edge computing environments](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2787)

- Repository
  - https://github.com/DNJha/IoTSim-Edge
- Venue
  - Software: Practice and Experience
- Date
  - 07 January 2020

### Motivation

Edge computing:
- close coupling between request and response
- delay incurred by centralized cloud-based deployment is unacceptable for latency-sensitive application
- network failure and data loss
- battery lifecycle of IoT device when sending all the data

Chanllges: diversity of devices, data formats, communication mediums, application scope, functional complexity, and programming models.

**Why not real-world deployment?** cost of setup and maintenance, controllability of devices in dynamic environment.

### Features

- **application composition** (DAG modeling);
- **edge communication protocol** (both application and transfer layers);
- mobility of IoT devices (handoff between fixed edge devices and moving IoT devices, moving speed and singla range)
- **battery drainage** (monitor the battery consumption)

### Architecture

Application management layer will manage the applications deployed in the edge environment. This layer is responsible for the application composition where an application is decomposed into a DAG of MELs, which abstracts both software and data.

- on the top of CloudSim
- communication among subscribed components (eg, broker, edge datacenter, and IoT resources) using an event management system
- edge datacenter consists of heterogeneous processing devices such as smartphone, laptop, Raspberry Pi, and single-server machine
- edge-IoT management layer consists of several components such as EdgeLet, policies, mobility, battery, synchronism, QoS, network protocols, communication protocols, transport protocols, and security protocols.
