### Motivation

Edge computing:
- close coupling between request and response
- delay incurred by centralized cloud-based deployment is unacceptable for latency-sensitive application
- network failure and data loss
- battery lifecycle of IoT device when sending all the data

Chanllges: diversity of devices, data formats, communication mediums, application scope, functional complexity, and programming models.

**Why not real-world deployment?** cost of setup and maintenance, controllability of devices in dynamic environment.

### Features

- **application composition** (DAG modeling);
- **edge communication protocol** (both application and transfer layers);
- mobility of IoT devices (handoff between fixed edge devices and moving IoT devices, moving speed and singla range)
- **battery drainage** (monitor the battery consumption)

### Architecture

![IoT Edge Computing Architecture](IoT-edge-architecture.png)

Application management layer will manage the applications deployed in the edge environment. This layer is responsible for the application composition where an application is decomposed into a DAG of MELs, which abstracts both software and data.

- on the top of CloudSim
- communication among subscribed components (eg, broker, edge datacenter, and IoT resources) using an event management system
- edge datacenter consists of heterogeneous processing devices such as smartphone, laptop, Raspberry Pi, and single-server machine
- edge-IoT management layer consists of several components such as EdgeLet, policies, mobility, battery, synchronism, QoS, network protocols, communication protocols, transport protocols, and security protocols.
