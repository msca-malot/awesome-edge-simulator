# Edge Computing Simulators

## EdgeCloudSim

[An environment for performance evaluation of edge computing systems](https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.3493)

  - Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies
- Date
  - 06 August 2018

### Motivation

- using a real cloud environment is not a cost-effective option due to the deployment requirements.
- working on the experimental test beds brings in difficulties regarding the repeatability of the experiments and scalability of the proposed architectures

Chanllenges:
- virtualized resources: integrating a computationalmodel of the virtualized resources and the fog devices requires more complex application models
- mobility: mobility of edge/fog devices affects many other modules.
- network: the interactions among the users, edge nodes, and the cloud may require different access technologies and topologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4G, and 5G
- extensibility: to customize and extend the modeling tool according to their requirements
- the ease of analysis: logs and output format

### Features

A modular architecture to provide support for a variety of crucial functionalities:
  - **network modeling** specific to WLAN and WAN
  - **device mobility model**
  - **realistic and tunable load generator**
  - **edge orchestrator** module to enable its users to model the orchestration actions

### Architecture

</p>

- The core simulation module 
  - is mainly responsible for loading and running the edge computing scenarios from the configuration files
- The edge orchestrator module fulfills the orchestration process.
  - edge orchestrator makes critical decisions such as creating new replicas, terminating the edge VMs, managing the computational resources of hosts, and offloading the tasks to the cloud or edge servers. It should collect information from the other entities to make the decision process more efficient.
- The networking module
  - handles the transmission delay in the WLAN and WAN by considering both upload and download data.
- The mobility module
  - each mobile device has x and y coordinates that are updated according to the dynamically managed hash table. In the current version, the mobile devices move according to the nomadic mobility model, but it can be extended to a different model according to the simulation scenario to be planned.
- The load generator module
  - is responsible for generating tasks for the given application configuration.

## IoTSim-Edge

[A simulation framework for modeling the behavior of Internet of Things and edge computing environments](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2787)

- Repository
  - https://github.com/DNJha/IoTSim-Edge
- Venue
  - Software: Practice and Experience
- Date
  - 07 January 2020

### Motivation

Edge computing:
- close coupling between request and response
- delay incurred by centralized cloud-based deployment is unacceptable for latency-sensitive application
- network failure and data loss
- battery lifecycle of IoT device when sending all the data

Chanllges: diversity of devices, data formats, communication mediums, application scope, functional complexity, and programming models.

**Why not real-world deployment?** cost of setup and maintenance, controllability of devices in dynamic environment.

### Features

- **application composition** (DAG modeling);
- **edge communication protocol** (both application and transfer layers);
- mobility of IoT devices (handoff between fixed edge devices and moving IoT devices, moving speed and singla range)
- **battery drainage** (monitor the battery consumption)

### Architecture

Application management layer will manage the applications deployed in the edge environment. This layer is responsible for the application composition where an application is decomposed into a DAG of MELs, which abstracts both software and data.
